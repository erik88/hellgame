# Changelog 2023-09-08

Based on playtest [2023-09-05](../playtests/2023-09-05.md)

## Factories

- Added the 2on1 rule: If you encounter a factory with another player's demon, you may place 2 demons. This zombifies the opponent's demon (essentially killing it), and
  enables you to get extra output from the factory.

## Curses

Added curse tokens.

Added curse table:

| Tokens | Effect                                                                                                      |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | -1 movement until next upkeep for target player                                                             |
| 1      | Take control of any demon on the square at which you are standing (including demons owned by other players) |
| 1      | Steal 2 souls from target player                                                                            |
