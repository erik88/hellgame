# Changelog 2023-10-10

Based on playtest [2023-10-10](../playtests/2023-10-10.md)

## Factory / Demon interactions

* At the end of turn (end of demon phase / phase 4):
  1. if a player has less demons than another player at a factory, those demons are killed.
  2. If there are more than 2 demons at a factory, kill the rest (kill the ones placed last).

## Mana

* Every player gains 1 mana each upkeep
  
## Trader balance

* Trader: ~~3 soul~~ 2 soul -> 1 mana
* Trader: 1 soul -> ~~10 move~~ 9 move

## Rule clarifications

* You can place as many demons as you like on a factory (but they will die at end of turn, see changes in [interactions](#factory--demon-interactions))
* Upkeep is only checked when moving the upkeep counter (if at limit, or beyond limit, move to the first slot).
* The upkeep counter cannot be moved earlier than the first slot.
* Hinderance can not be placed on other players, waylings or special squares.

## UX Changes

* Change color of _flipped factories_
* Add description to _flipped sources_
* Turn _legend_ and _turn order_ into cards (so you can Alt-click them)
